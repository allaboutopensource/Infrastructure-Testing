# Infrastructure-Testing
This repo is for the unit and the integration test cases for our infrastructure. This repository typically contains code, scripts, and configuration files specifically designed to validate and verify the correctness, stability, and security of the infrastructure components that support the application or service.

The primary purpose of an Infrastructure-Testing repository is to ensure that the infrastructure components, such as infrastructure-as-code (IaC) templates, deployment scripts, configurations, and related services, function as expected and adhere to best practices.
